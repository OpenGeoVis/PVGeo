<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the ParaView for Geophysics Documentation! This repository is all about using ParaView in the geosciences for data and model visualization. Through visualization, we can bring value to data and hold the products of geoscience in a new light to interested parties.</p>
<p>This repository was produced from the work of an undergraduate research project at the Colorado School of Mines titled: Illuminating the Value of Geophysical Imaging through Visualization and Virtual Reality. Checkout <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6v2US3m042-MFIwUy1uUTlfVHM/view?usp=sharing">this PDF</a> standalone presentation to learn more about the project.</p>
<p>Use the Sidebar (to the left) to explore the docs page and to find all documentation for readers, filters, macros, and more as you need.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>Check out the data scene below. This is an example of three data sets visually integrated using our framework and exported to a shareable format. Go ahead, click it and move it around!</p>

<h1 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to build plugins for the open-source, multi-platform, data analysis, and visualization application <a href="https://www.paraview.org">ParaView</a> by Kitware. These plugins are tailored to the visualization of spatially referenced data in the geosciences. The overarching  goal of this project is to develop a framework to funnel geophysical data/models into virtual reality for the purpose of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extracting Value of Information (VOI)</li>
<li>User/Stakeholder engagement with geophysical findings</li>
<li>Communicating uncertainty in an useable way</li>
</ul>
<p>My specific goal is to develop a heavily documented library of plugins, macros, and examples of how to view standard formats of geoscientific and geophysical data on the ParaView software platform. These plugins will provide tools to perform post-processing visual analysis and interpretation of geoscientific data and models.</p>
<p>Through the deployment of this software, geophysicists will gain an ability to represent their 3D spatially referenced data intuitively to interested parties and stakeholders. By integrating the visualization of various data, interested parties will gain insight into the value of the information in the models. A spatially defined 3D model yields minimal value to an outside party unless they can relate that model to other spatial features. For example, a 3D model of faults in the subsurface is unhelpful unless the location of known features to interested parties can be displayed simultaneously. To give a value of information, we must be able to show where the spatially referenced data is in relation to intuitive features like topography, well locations, survey points, or other known features. Through visual integration, we try to mimic the reality of the space in which data was acquired so that it will hold meaning to anyone that immerses into the visualization regardless of background.</p>
<h2 id="recent-abstract-submission">Recent Abstract Submission</h2>
<p>The results of geophysical imaging techniques often hold high significance to stakeholders in the problems addressed yet the effective perception of those results remains a dynamic challenge for all. To illuminate the value of geophysical imaging techniques, we are developing a framework to visually integrate geophysical data and models in 3D which extends into Virtual Reality (VR) as well as statistically analyzing interpretation advantages in VR. The motivation for this effort comes from a desire to directly engage stakeholders with geophysical data gaining Value of Information (VOI) and de-risking decision making in project planning. This framework is a code base that extends the functionality of the open-source visualization platform ParaView by Kitware. These extensions make it possible to visually integrate geophysical data in a multidimensional rendering space so that the end product is interpretable to non-geoscientists and that all parties can gain insight and VOI from geophysical imaging techniques. To show value in the VR presentation of multi-dimensional visualizations, we aim to develop metrics that will analyze the effectiveness of visual analysis in VR compared to traditional methods. We will evaluate these metrics through statistical gaming type protocol, where we will task subjects with making spatial decisions and finding features of interest in complex geoscientific scenes. We hypothesize that VR will bring the needed perception to most efficiently make spatial decisions and detect features of interest as well as convey information such as uncertainty in a usable manner. We will have preliminary results of the gaming protocol by March 2018 as well as share our visual framework along that journey in the form of a GitHub repository titled “ParaViewGeophysics.” Our goal in sharing the repository is to deliver a toolset that enables geophysicists to rapidly visualize their data and models as well as effectively communicate their findings to interested stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="outline-of-goals">Outline of Goals</h2>
<p>These are the goals to achieve through publishing this repository but not necessarily the goals of the research project from which this repository was developed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop and document geoscientific plugins for ParaView. These plugins will take advantage of ParaView and VTK’s Python wrapping and use the Python Programmable Filter in ParaView. The advantage to using Python Programmable filters is that they are easily modified by the end user and can be wrapped in XML to create a GUI for its use in ParaView while having the option to directly edit the source code live in ParaView.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Readers: Plugins that read common geoscientific and geophysical spatial data files (GSLIB, UBC mesh, ESRI grid, etc.). Also make readers that read common raw data files (packed binary floats, delimited ASCII, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filters: Plugins that perform post-processing analysis of geoscientific data for visualization. For example, filters that build tubes from a series of points that represent a tunnel or filters that take a 1D array, reshape it to 2D or 3D, and make a volumetric model ready for visualization all while adding spatial reference for visual integration.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sources: Plugins that create simple synthetic data sources such as a sphere or cube with a specified attribute like a spatially varying density or electrical conductivity. Other sources might include using that synthetic sphere or cube to make a volumetric field of some response.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make tutorials on the use of ParaView&rsquo;s native features and the plugins distributed in this repository on open source data (for example):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Document explanations of how to get sophisticated geoscientific data formats like topography DEMs into a format ParaView can read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document how to use ParaView’s native filters to complete common tasks in the visualization of geoscientific data. For example, applying satellite imagery to a surface that represents topography.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop customizable macros for the visualization of common data formats. This will include developing macros on an individual basis to help others quickly visualize their data and models for quality assessment and individual research needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="features-on-their-way">Features on Their Way</h1>
<p>Here is a list of features that are shortly coming to this repo. This list will be regularly updated</p>
<p>Documentation is soon to come. We want to do it right: with tutorials, examples, and detailed justification for need and use of each reader and filter.</p>
<p>Suggestions? Post on the <a href="https://github.com/banesullivan/ParaViewGeophysics/issues">Issues page</a> as a feature request.</p>
