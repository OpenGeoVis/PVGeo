Contributing
============

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We absolutely welcome contributions and we hope that this guide will facilitate
an understanding of the *PVGeo* code repository. It is important to note that
the *PVGeo* software package is maintained on a volunteer basis and thus we need
to foster a community that can support user questions and develop new features
to make this software a useful tool for geoscientists.

This page is dedicated to outline where you should start with your question,
concern, feature request, or desire to contribute.

Questions
---------

For general questions about the project, its applications, or about the
non-technical, please do not create an issue but join us on
[slack](http://slack.pvgeo.org) or send one of the developers an email.
The current project maintainer is Bane Sullivan, feel
free to inquire with Bane through `Banes website`_.

For more technical questions, you are welcome to create an issue on the
`issues page`_ with a *question* label which we will try to address.
Through posting on the issues page, your question can be addressed by community
members with the needed expertise and the information gained will remain
available on the issues page for other users.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you stumble across any bugs, crashes, or concerning quirks while using code
distributed here, please report it on the `issues page`_ with an
appropriate label so we can promptly address it.
When reporting an issue, please be overly descriptive so that we may reproduce it.
Whenever possible, please provide tracebacks, screenshots, and sample files
to help us address the issue.

Feature Requests
----------------

We encourage users to submit ideas for improvements to *PVGeo* code base!
Please create an issue on the `issues page`_ with a *Feature Request*
label to suggest an improvement.
Please use a descriptive title and provide ample background information to help
the community implement that functionality. For example, if you would like a
reader for a specific file format, please provide a link to documentation of
that file format and possibly provide some sample files with screenshots to work
with. We will use the issue thread as a place to discuss and provide feedback.

Contributing New Code
---------------------

If you have an idea for how to improve *PVGeo*, please first create an issue as
a feature request which we can use as a discussion thread to work through how to
implement the contribution.

Once you are ready to start coding and develop for *PVGeo*, please take a look
at the remainder of the pages in this Development Guide.
