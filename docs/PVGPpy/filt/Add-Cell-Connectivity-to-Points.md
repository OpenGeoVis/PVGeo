This filter will add linear cell connectivity between scattered points. You have the option to add VTK_Line or VTK_PolyLine connectivity. VTK_Line connectivity makes a straight line between the points in order (either in the order by index or using a nearest neighbor calculation). The VTK_PolyLine adds a poly line connectivity between all points as one spline (either in the order by index or using a nearest neighbor calculation).
